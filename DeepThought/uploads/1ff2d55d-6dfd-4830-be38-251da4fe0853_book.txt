The Clockmaker’s Apprentice

In the village of Windmere, nestled between the cliffs and a whispering forest, there lived an old clockmaker named Thaddeus Finch. He was known for crafting timepieces so precise that they could predict the weather. Every clock ticked in harmony, as though enchanted.

Thaddeus had no family, but he did have an apprentice — a bright young girl named Eliot. She arrived at his workshop one stormy night in 1883, soaked to the bone and claiming to be from the year 2021. Thaddeus, amused by her imagination, let her stay anyway.

Eliot quickly became indispensable, learning to carve gears and balance pendulums with an almost supernatural ease. By the time she turned sixteen, she had completed her own masterpiece: a grandfather clock that counted backward.

“It tells the future,” she explained to a confused but proud Thaddeus. He nodded, though he’d gone deaf after a lightning strike during the summer storm of 1895 — two years before Eliot arrived.

One day, Thaddeus vanished without a trace, leaving only a note: “Time is a circle. I have stepped outside of it.” Eliot read it with trembling hands, though she had gone blind the winter before after an accident with molten brass.

With Thaddeus gone, Eliot took over the shop. Tourists often visited Windmere to see the famous workshop, especially curious since the entire village had burned down in 1879 and was never rebuilt.
